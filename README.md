# -OralDiseaseClassification
Oral Disease Classification Using Deep Learning This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning model for classifying oral diseases into two categories: Caries and Gingivitis. The project leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze and classify oral disease images with high accuracy.
Project Features
Preprocessing of oral disease image data, including resizing and normalization.
Use of ImageDataGenerator for data augmentation to enhance model robustness.
A CNN architecture with layers like Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, and Dropout for classification.
Model training and evaluation with detailed performance metrics, including confusion matrix and classification report.
Implementation of test image prediction with class-wise labels for easy interpretation.
Saved model file for reuse and testing on new data.


Model Performance
Accuracy: Achieved 91% test accuracy.
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: Evaluated using a confusion matrix and classification report.
