# -OralDiseaseClassification
Oral Disease Classification Using Deep Learning This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning model for classifying oral diseases into two categories: Caries and Gingivitis. The project leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze and classify oral disease images with high accuracy.
